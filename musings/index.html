    <p>Babli didi rubbed her eyes open. As the small screen on her Nokia dabba phone showed 3:30AM, she got up from her bed and went to get ready. Hair still wet from the cold tap water, she went to the kitchen and prepared breakfast and lunch for when the rest of the household would wake. After her morning pooja, she took out her neatly ironed uniform from her almirah with a smile and changed. As she went back into her room, her phone showed 5:30AM, and now she hurried to wake up her own son. After making sure he had had eaten his breakfast, she packed her bag with the pen her father had given to her on her wedding day, a shawl¬ for the cold bus stop, and of course, the attendance register. </p>

<p>As she walked to the bus stop, she thought about the significance of the day. She had overheard the teachers talking about the graduation day, and with a sinking feeling in her heart, she realized that today would be the last day that she would see them. As the wind got chilly, she rubbed her hands together, before calling the bus driver, “Haan bhaiya, kahan ho aap?” </p>

<p>Ten minutes later, he climbed onto the bus. He didn’t look at her face, nor did he make any recognition of the fact that she stood there. He was attempting to hide his phone in his sweatshirt pocket as he climbed up the stairs, but the neon earphones dangling from his pocket were a dead giveaway. But it was one of those things; she would pretend she hadn’t seen it, and he would say nothing. As he settled himself down in the backseat, she thought about his first day in the bus.</p>

<p>His mother had dropped him off to the bus stop, and he smiled and waved as the bus came near. With a tiffin in his small hands and a water canteen around his neck, he had jumped onto the bus, laughing, saying “Good morning didi!” And she would smile back at him, make sure that he wore his seatbelt, and try to keep him quiet when the teachers and seniors got on the bus. </p>

<p>Over time, he had changed – naturally. The next year saw him finding his place in the depths of different books, and she would observe him, lost in his own adventures and oblivious to what was happening around him. She would have to remind him when his bus stop came, and he jumped down the stairs while she shouted after him, telling him to be careful.</p>

<p>The next year, he made friends in the back of the bus, and the entire ride was a non – stop session of him talking, and talking, and talking. And it was truly a pain to keep him in his seat, as his friends ran up and down the aisle, spending all their time playing games.</p>

<p>The following year was significantly different – suddenly, the space he had found safe had turned into a stressful place to catch up on homework, and often classwork. As a result, he almost always left a book or a pen behind in the bus, but she would promptly hand it to him before he left the bus. Sometimes she felt sorry for the happy little boy when she saw just how thick his textbooks were. </p>

<p>The next year was characterized by the demon from her own past: boards. She herself had made her entire village ¬proud with a pass certificate and a crisp 50%. But the boy was ambitious, and his parents wanted him to aim for nothing less than a 90%. The bus ride turned into a safe place again, but to catch up on sleep. Sleep centered weeks interspersed with sudden coffee induced days of studying were not an exception, but a norm.</p>

<p>The next year was characterized by untidy hair. Late to the bus, relaxed; it was truly a fun sight to see him so destressed after exams. And soon, she watched him fall in love. It started with them walking to the bus everyday, the brief hug they shared, and the way he would smile when someone mentioned her name. She was happy for him: as long as the girl didn’t break his heart.</p>

<p>And of course, the final year. Music, projects, and sleep. The bus ride had become just another place to get away from it all. And she seemed invisible to him now; even when she had to wake him from his deep slumber when his stop came, he merely nodded and grabbed his things. But she understood. Life was short, and sadly, his time to even say namaste to his bus didi was expendable.</p>

<p>Somehow, the last six years had come full circle. Sure, he had evolved from a little boy to a towering giant, but deep down, it was still the same, cheerful, excited soul.</p>

<p>As the bus rolled into the basketball court and the kids got off the bus, she observed him, one last time, as he grabbed his books, his laptop, and his characteristic coffee mug. And as he walked up to the front, he saw her, gazing at him.</p>

<p>He stopped, and he smiled. Or had she just imagined it? And with that, the boy stepped off the bus, and out of her life.</p>

<p>Forever.</p>

    <p>
      <p>Jacob had never really understood the meaning of someone’s life flashing before their eyes. There were too many unanswered questions for him in that line. What guaranteed death after the flash? How did people know there would be a flash, if no one had lived to tell the tale? What decided if something was worth being included in the final reel that would be projected before his eyes? Surely a good forty years of memories could not be summed up in a flash. And perhaps the most intriguing of all, who decided that your life was about to end? But strapped, bound and gagged to the hard, wooden chair in the cold warehouse, surrounded by a group of ‘educated’, ‘progressive’, ‘advanced’, ‘modern’ white men in ski masks, he felt a chill run up his spine and like a slow eighties projector, the film started playing before his eyes. </p>

      <p>Jacob remembered the age of nine, when he had been playing in the sand pit of the local park that they were allowed to use and Sandra had walked up to him and started to play with him. He remembered running away, a stranger to female companionship, seeking refuge in the arms of another boy of colour, Matt. He remembered the waves of feelings of love and affection he had felt for the tall lean boy throughout his journey through the school for ‘blacks’ and how he had tried to spend every free second of his childhood with the only person who could make him feel happiness and true joy. His head spun as he remembered the conversation he had had with his parents when he had told them he was different. They had tried to explain to him that black men already faced enough discrimination and to add to those problems was suicide. They had tried to take him to a psychiatrist, got him on pills and even tried introducing him to gorgeous women. They were so fixated with the dream of a normal son that when all else failed, they tried to suppress his feelings the good old way, with a belt and a stick. </p>

      <p>He remembered his valedictorian speech, after which he had kissed Matt with all the courage he could muster. Although only a few people actually showed up for, it had caused a quite an uproar in the small town they lived in. He remembered a feeling, something indescribable that he had felt when it happened. It was on the tip of his tongue, but it was lost to him right now. </p>

      <p>He remembered getting his first job in Wisconsin, an accountant for this big law firm. He relived his first speech amongst his peers, the one where he had officially come out of the closet and accepted himself for who he was. He had hoped for everyone to accept him as well, but his naivety was now almost as much of a deterrent as the foul stench of a ‘Jesus-hater’, a category he now apparently fell in according to the spray-painted message on his car. Gradually he began being left out of office meetings and was soon fired under false pretences. He relocated to a quiet house in a small neighborhood of white people, with their characteristic Sunday barbecues and pleasing personalities. And yet, here they stood in front of him, dressed in ski masks as if concealing their identity could lessen the pain they were to inflict on him. </p>

      <p>But after all this, he felt no shame. He felt pleased with himself for not losing himself in the great abyss of other people’s expectations and remaining true to who he really was. The feeling was back again. Jordan racked his brains to find the word for it.
      Aaah. He had finally remembered the word for what he felt. He closed his eyes, head held high with the idea of closure, and his chest outstretched with his last breath of pride. </p>

      <p> It was the last feeling he experienced before the 22 millimeter caliber shotgun broke the silence of the night as the bullet landed in his chest, centimeters from his broken heart. The white men took off their masks, content with the idea that they had rid society of a misfit. As Jordan’s body went cold, so did the chances of black men across the world coming out of the closet that narrow-minded society had created for them.

  <section class="section section-dark">
    <p>​It was a silent night. The cool wind blew through the icy streets of East London. As the Big Ben sounded twelve gongs, most of London was already asleep.

    Just a minute after midnight, Mrs. Baker, an old lady of sixty-five was twisting and turning uncomfortably in her bed. She lived alone; her husband had died a long while back, and her only company, her daughter Alice, was abroad to secure a teaching position in America.</p>​
    <p1>​At half past twelve, Mrs. Baker was awoken by a harsh knock on the door. There was, as clichéd as this may sound, no one at the door.</p1>​
    <p>​Mrs. Baker, not ready to sleep, went to the kitchen to make herself a cup of tea. While the water in the kettle boiled, she sat down on a wooden chair in a corner of the dark kitchen. A touch of arthritis and a common flu at her age was common; she had not the strength which youth had given her.</p>​
    <p1>​Looking at the pictures on the wall, she smiled to herself. They were a timeline of Alice’s lifetime: her birth, her first bicycle, her graduation, and countless others. The newest addition to this wall was the picture of Alice leaving for America, hugging her loving and affectionate mother.</p1>​
    <p1>​In retrospect, Mrs. Baker remembered, the idea for the wall had never been hers. Her husband had started it, but was never able to see the end of what he had started. He had died when Alice had been at the tender age of five. Mrs. Baker had decided that she would complete her husband’s work for him.</p1>​
    <p1>​Suddenly, her train of thought was broken by the overflowing kettle. At a speed that she could manage, she rushed to the counter and turned off the switch for the gas.</p>​
    <p1>​In this silence she heard a voice. A frail voice, like one in pain. Mrs. Baker was petrified. Not because of the frailness of the voice. Certainly not because of the unexplainable origin of the voice. No, she was scared because the voice was Alice’s.</p>​
    <p1>​“Mum?” the voice whispered.
    “Yes Alice, honey, come home, you’re scaring me,” said Mrs. Baker her voice now also reduced to a whisper.
    “I cannot come back, Mum,” said the silent voice.
    “But why, Alice?” asked the whispering mother now in tears.
    “I am with god, Mum” said the voice, and it was the last time it communicated with the mortal realm.</p1>​
    <p1>​The next morning, Mrs. Baker was found dead, lying on the carpeted floor. The doctors claimed it was heart failure, and the case was closed. It was said that the shock of her daughter leaving her had crippled her mind and her body.</p>​
    <p1>​The policemen at Scotland Yard tried to find out where Alice was, to tell her the grave news. It was later found that Alice had died in America, where her taxi had crashed into a pillar, causing an immediate and painless death.</p>​
    <p1>​However, there were two intriguing parts of the whole case. A picture of Alice’s crushed taxi had been crudely nailed to the wall (which eyewitnesses swore had never been there before), and whoever entered the house was assured that phantoms dwelled in it because each visitor heard the whisper, a silent cry, of the dead woman’s last words:</p>​
    <p1>​“Alice, I'm coming.”

    <p>​He looked down into his cup of coffee. The last quart of the Starbucks black espresso looked quite tempting. He had to enjoy his last moments after all. What better way than a cup of Starbucks black coffee? But he knew that if he turned back now, he’d never be able to do it. He’d live a failure’s life, mocked by the few who actually knew him. He put the cup on the ledge and stared down. A multicolored nebula of traffic faced him. Not that it could harm someone who was sitting on the 184th floor.</p>

    <p>The words kept ringing in his mind, “Um…sorry, but I have a fiancé.” Stupid Jack. He had spent the last three months hooked on the phone and in the office, just to hear her voice, to see her smile. Endless and countless conversations yet he still knew nothing about her.</p>

    <p>He saw his life flash before his eyes, but it wasn’t worth watching. He was already on the clear white pavement before the seagulls realized that the green and white cup was full of revolting black coffee.

      <p>​As soon as he saw the child, John looked away and pulled his cap down to cover his face. While the child struggled to unload her suitcase from the conveyor belt, John ordered a smoked decaf from the Starbucks at the end of the airport. He observed the girl from the corner of his eye. She was wearing a  pair of denim jeans, a black jacket and a pair of sneakers. She had an iPod in her pocket which was connected to a pair of expensive headphones that were wrapped around her neck. John made a mental reminder to analyse his victims before he agreed to a payment. Being new to the field was hard enough without wealthy businessmen cheating you out of money. He turned around and fixated his glance on the girl who was now loading the suitcase in a trolley. He quickened his pace and exited the airport, throwing his fake passport and fake moustache in the bin. </p>

      <p>He proceeded to the taxi stand and climbed into the taxi he had bought from a Swiss account three days ago. He turned around and reversed the taxi out of the parking lot, slightly banging into a local French couple.
        "Qu'est ce qui ne vas pas chez toi?"
        "Pardon, pardon!" muttered John, while swearing under his breath. He couldn't have any eyewitnesses around. He drove up outside the airport and waited for the girl to come. As she approached the curb, John grabbed her suitcase and put it in the back seat saying,
        "Come on! Let's go! I give 50 euro off! Limited time offer!" The girl weighed her options and shrugged and got in. John smiled to himself. Now came the easy bit."Where you go to?"
        "Fort Notre," replied the girl.</p>

      <p>"Si, yes, I take you there," said Jack. He started the car and exited the airport and caught the freeway. After a while of listening to the radio, he switched on the air ventilation system, while putting on a mask himself. He took the car to the outskirts of the little French town and stopped the car behind a willow tree. He lifted the unconscious girl and put her in the trunk, not wondering once about what would happen to her next or if she would even see daylight again. He dialed the only number on his phone, watching the numbers in the bank account went up until they reached seven and six zeroes. He took off his fake brown skin to reveal the fair man beneath. Taking out the cycle from underneath the seat, he rode off into the distance,  never to be seen in quaint little Ars-en-Ré again.

          The White Gloves in Central Park
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <section class="section section-light">
      <p>​He’s here. I can feel him. I don’t think I have much time left.</p>

      <p>It was two nights ago. I was strolling through Central Park when I heard a girl screaming. The scream was coming from where the carousels are. But when I got there, I didn’t see anyone. But here’s the strange part. The carousel was supposed to be closed. But it was spinning round and round, its dainty little music playing and the lights flashing on and on. With nobody in sight, it seemed really eerie. And that’s when I heard them. The swings behind me creaking silently. Unwillingly, I told myself to turn around and look. On the swings sat a doll. The doll was holding onto each of the ropes with a small cloth hand. Its face had been torn apart by a swift blade and a red liquid was oozing out of it. As I watched on, unable to move, a pair of white gloved hands reached from the bushes behind the swings and grabbed the doll.</p>

      <p>Call me a coward but I ran. I ran for my life. I dropped my dinner on the way but by the time I got home I had lost my appetite. When I got to my home I picked up my mail, grabbed the flyer sticking out of the door and rushed inside and bolted the door. I hid beneath my covers. I think I must have fallen asleep then because the next thing I know was my dogs licking me to wake me up and get them breakfast.
      I took the flyer from the night before and put the dog dish on top of it. After my dogs were done eating their food all that was left of the flyer was the picture of a clown.</p>

      <p>That evening as I was returning from work, I decided to not walk through Central Park. I took a cab back home to the West Side from the doorstep of my office. Funnily enough, the cab was some futuristic cab with a partition between the driver’s seat and my seat. Halfway into the ride, I felt the same eerie presence. Needless to say I ditched the cab at the next red light. Now that it was ten at night, there were no taxis around. I had to cut through Central Park.</p>

      <p>With my revolver out and my eyes wide open I rushed through the park. Luckily the only soul I met was this newspaper boy who was giving out flyers for the circus. I got home with only my work bag and the New York Times and a few flyers. </p>

      <p>I put on a nice movie and fell asleep somewhere in the middle. When I woke up, my dogs were nowhere to be found. I drowsily opened my eyes and maneuvered myself to the living room. And behold, there were hundreds of flyer of the same circus. When I looked closely all there was on each flyer was a clown with a blood red smile and white gloves. And on his vest I could see that little doll and my two dogs. And his finger was pointed straight towards my chest.
      </p>

      <p>Without getting dressed and without greeting the morning walkers I ran to my psychiatrist’s office and took a seat. One by one the patients kept leaving the office with a blank expression on their face. Once all of them had left, the receptionist took of her white gloves and entered Dr. Sheila’s room. </p>

      <p>That’s how I know. The clown. He’s here. But somehow the connection seems different now. Oh, he’s here all right. But not in my world. I can still sense him through the barrier that separates you from me. Turn around.</p>

      <p>He’s here. I can feel him. I don’t think YOU have much time left…<br />
